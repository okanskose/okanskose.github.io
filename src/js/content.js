                'The goal of this project was to develop an application to render visually stunning 3D-fractals in real-time and allowing the user to interact with them. The software should run on computers with a low computational power while still using high resolutions (up to 4k).',
                'Fractals are shapes with a rough, complex and also fascinating surface. Taking a look to the nature, revelas many different fractal shapes, for instance, romanesco. Romanesco is built up by shape looking like a triangle, on which again smaller triangles exists. This is one main characteristic of fractals, called self-similarity: a magnified region of the fractal shape will be either exactly the same or similar to the whole fractal shape. This leads to the second main characteristic of a fractal: Their length is undefined. This means, that zooming to the edge or surface of a fractal results in getting new complex shapes and structures. Maybe the most famous example for this is the problme "How Long Is the Coast of Britain?" by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot.',
                'Such complex shapes can be visualized digitally by iterating mathematical functions (complex numbers) for each pixel on the screen. For instance, the most well-known fractal, the Mandelbrotset: z_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c<br>Because the computations for each pixel can be performed independently, parallelization on the GPU is the key for archieving interactive real-time capable 3D-fractals. Computing the 3D-fractals is accomplished on GPU using a technique called ray machting distance fields. '

High latencies between interaction and feedback or inaccurate tracking of the user‚Äôs movement can lead to simulator sickness. Within the scope of this project, we researched the most appropriate solutions for the described challenge by testing multiple tracking and virtual reality technologies. A fast and precise network-based system was developed using OptiTrack as an infrared based marker tracking solution and Samsung GearVR as a wireless head-mounted display. The introduced system offers an interface to control an application with a trampoline. For instance, the system provides methods to request the average jump duration or the user‚Äôs current jump height. In addition, it handles interactions or changes the virtual jump height mapping. Two prototypes were developed, exemplarily implementing the interface in gaming experiences. We chose one of them to test the system with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire.',

Additionally, algorithmically composed ambient sound is synthesized, also depending on the biometrical parameters of the user. Mapping those data onto the 3D-fractals enables a diverse influence to the structur of 3d-fractal illustrations, which again yields to an individualized user experience.
